# RotaryPad-Files
nircmd.ahk - AHK background script for using my RotaryPad to contol system volumes via NirCmd commands.
This is inspired by the methods used by Taran at https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard.

Most of the script should be easy to understand with my annotations and if you're familiar with AHK. The first portion of the script is for translating encoder turns, presses, and holds into raise/lower, mute, and setvalue calls for NirCmd. The second portion is a side bit for Discord emote calls. 
A guide to NirCmd commands can be found at https://nircmd.nirsoft.net/.
